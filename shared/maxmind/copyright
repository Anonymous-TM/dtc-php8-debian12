For the people that might worry about the license of the maxmind API,
here's what I got in my mail today:

Hi Thomas,

We are okay with re-licensing under LGPL for the PHP api.

However, rather than build a new release, would it be okay if we just 
confirm via e-mail that we are licensing the PHP API to you under LGPL? 
Saves us some time.
