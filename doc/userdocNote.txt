Notes :

- Beware ! On my current debian system, the php.ini for php4 launched as
cgi (in the cron for example) was not including some .so modules (so
for example mysql connection is not possible).

- client site can share the same autoSQLconfig.php script as the admin site,
because if oneday, connection is not possible, login & password to the DTC
tables will not apear in a clear form thanks to the $conf_mysql_conf_ok="yes"
that locks the parameters. The mysql_config.php is changed to root:root once
configured by the DTC admin panel, (as well as the dtc's "shared/"
directory) by the cron.php script. If you don't want to enable the crontab script,
remember to chown this folder manualy.
Version prior to 0.10.7-3 didn't do the chown. It's up to the sysadmin to do
it.

- please don't spread any mysql_config.php : this is YOUR config file with
YOUR mysql root password in clear text in it !!!
