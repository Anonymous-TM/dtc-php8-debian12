<h3><a name="1"></a>1 What is DTC?</h3>

<h4><a name="1.1"></a>1.1 What does DTC do?</h4>

Domain Technologie Control (DTC) is a complete webhosting package
delivering web GUI for admin of bind, apache, qmail...
DTC is a set of PHP scripts and a web interface that manage a MySQL database
that handles all the host information. It generates backup scripts, statistic
calculation scripts, and config files for bind, Apache, qmail, and proftpd,
using a single system UID/GID. With DTC, you can delegate the task of creating
subdomains, email, and FTP accounts to users for the domain names they own.

<h4><a name="1.2"></a>1.2 Who should read this doccument?</h4>

This doc is for unix server administrators that have root acccess to a server
that have a minimum knowledge of internet services, and that wish to
installe or use DTC. If you are a simple user of DTC (you have one or more
domain name hosted), please read the integrated help.<br><br>

<h4><a name="1.3"></a>1.3 Good points of DTC</h4>

If you are used to others web GUI to configurate fastly your servers
(http, ftp, etc.) on an unix machine, you will be surprised by the
ease and speed of use of DTC. It's main goal was to be the most hergonomic
as possible for final user, minimising task number.<br><br>

The biggest diference between Webmin and DTC for example, is that webmin
has a services aproache (one server, one module to configure that server).
DTC does the opposite, and centralise all the tasks in one unic interface.
For example, when an admin add a domain to DTC, the configuration is updated
for both apache, bind and qmail.<br><br>

<h4><a name="1.4"></a>1.4 Technologies used by DTC</h4>

DTC is based on PHP scripts and on a MySQL database allowing configuration
of your domains. For the moment, the following servers are supported:<br><br>

- The name server <b>bind</b> and all RFC compatible name servers (<a href="http://www.isc.org">http://www.isc.org</a>)<br>
- The webserver <b>apache</b> (<a href="http://www.apache.org">http://www.apache.org</a>)<br>
- The ftp server <b>proftpd</b> (<a href="http://www.proftpd.org">http://www.proftpd.org</a>)<br>
- The module <b>mod_sql</b> for proftpd<br>
- The Mail Transport Agent (MTA) <b>qmail</b> (<a href="http://www.qmail.org">http://www.qmail.org</a>)<br><br>

Choices on thoses programs has been motivated by the avalability of thoses programs
under lot's of Unix systems. Please note that it would be easy to add compatibility
to other servers (I'm thiking namely about exim, postfix, or pureftpd), and that
all contributions are welcomes.<br><br>

To be able to use fully DTC, you can install the followings:<br>
- The module <b>mod_log_sql</b> that logs trafic HTTP in MySQL database
(<a href="http://www.grubbybaby.com/mod_log_sql/">http://www.grubbybaby.com/mod_log_sql/</a>)<br>
- The addon for qmail <b>mysqmail</b> that logs POP3 and SMTP trafic in MySQL
(<a href="http://www.gplhost.com/?rub=software&sousrub=dtc">http://www.gplhost.com/?rub=software&sousrub=dtc</a>)<br>
- The statistic generator tool <b>Webalizer</b> that parses CommonLog access.log
standard file to produce it's stats (<a href="http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/">http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/</a>)<br>
<br>
DTC can also be used to work as a backup solution, compressing all domain files in a tar file.<br><br>

<h4><a name="1.5"></a>1.5 DTC's possibilities</h4>

- Nearly unlimited number of user<br>
- Number of domains and subzone (nearly) unlimited<br>
- Use only <b>one system UID/GID</b> (if you don't coun't does for the deamons)<br>
- No conflict with the same email name for a different domain (for example
with postnamster@domaine1.com and postmaster@domaine2.com)
butwithout using vpopmgr (standalone qmail package)<br>
- <b>Monitoring of band width usage per services and per users.</b><br>
- Integrate 2 paiement systep (for the moment paypal and worldpay)<br>
- Working with the help of openSRS-PHP lib to register domain name to Tucows
(you need to have a Tucows account).<br>
- Working with a <b>skin system</b> that allow changing of the interface visuals.<br>
- NAT support (realy conveinient if you have a web server running in a natted LAN network).<br>
- SSL support<br>
- Modular programming allowing easy changes (aspecialy for conf file generation).<br>
- Compatible with almost all browsers: Internet Explorer, Mozilla, lynx/links, .. (no
frames, and javascript confirmations can be disabled).<br><br>

<h4><a name="1.6"></a>1.6 How does it works</h4>

DTC write all hosting informations for it's services in a MySQL database. It then reuse it to
generate config files for apache, qmail, and bind. Whenever it was easily possible, some MySQL
modules for some daemons where used, but sometimes, it was better not to use them and still use
generated configurations files. Sometimes, there was no other options.<br><br>

Once installed, DTC grant access to 2 types of interface. One for the root administrator (we will
call it root-admin), and one for final customer (the client interface, or virtual admin).
The root-admin will add domain names to it's clients, and grant access to them. The client will
be allowed to add or change mail, ftp, zones, mx, and the data of his domains.<br><br>
