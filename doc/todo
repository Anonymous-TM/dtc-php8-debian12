concept of index and keys...
- Add support for wildcard DNS & Apache ServerAlias entries
- Make the user deletion delete new type of database (recursively)
- Make dpkg-reconfigure regenerat the config files for named & apache:
  it should be asking for use_vnat, but it's not working.
- Replace the # caracter in table names by $ so it works with v2 of mod_log_sql
- Detect if it's mod_log_sql2 and change the connect directive accordingly
- Add support for DNS wildcard

- Add support for spamassassin & clamav
- Finish resseller interface (enable quota and flag edition of subadmins)

- Finish tucows API integration: working in Tucows test server, transfer
of domain names to be finished using the bulk_transfer() function
- Make a windows port for cygwin using NDIS scriptable installer.
