Hello %%%FIRST_NAME%%%,

This is an automated message sent by the Domain Technologie
Control (DTC) robot.

Your Xen Virtual Server (VPS) %%%VPS_NUMBER%%%:%%%VPS_NODE%%%
has expired %%%VPS_EXPIRED_DAYS%%% days ago, on the: %%%EXPIRATION_DATE%%%.

Please login into your control panel at %%%DTC_CLIENT_URL%%%,
click on your VPS tab, and renew it.

This is our last warning before we shutdown your VPS. Please
understand that we can't keep your VPS running as we need the
space for other customers, and that hosting has to be paid in
advance.

Best regards,
