Hi folks !

1. What is that file talkingabout.
This small documentation is for developers or package maintainer only.
It's for helping packaging DTC for new OS. (quickly written,
did re-read... :).

I personaly use debian, but I've tried to build for other OS.
Each individual OS has a makeXXX sh script for building. sh is
the most reliable shell (eg it's always located in /bin/sh on
all unix).

2. How does building package work ?
At source/ folder toplevel (relative to this help file) 
you will find the scripts files that are used on ALL cases
(eg on all unix system). But as you see in it, it's using
variables not setup and there is no #!/bin/sh in top of
them.

This is because all distribs are responsable for setting
thoses vars according to there specificities. So in the
sources/ folder, there is a folder for each unix OS that is
supported by the current DTC release.

RPM suxs:
Normaly, it's possible to build all packages on all unix.
But for RPM, you have to setup an area for building it.
See the specific script (in source/redhat) for creating
that RPMBUILD in your home directory.

3. Automatic repository script
The "makeDTC" sh script will launch all "makeXXX" script
and copy all in /home/ftp (all done in one action).
It will also build a debian repository for woody in
"deb ftp://localhost/debian stable main" so you can
have quick tests of the install for debian users...
If you want to use CVS (and participate to DTC effort)
please do a ./clean beffore doing a "cvs commit".

4. Starting to build a port for an other OS
If you want to start to build a new package for a new unix
system (remaining to do: gentoo, bsd "make install" port,
OS X (mac), windows+cygwin, mint, solaris, aix... :)
then first copy what's written for building the tarball
package (read my makeTarball sh script, you will see
it's not doing very mutch... :).
Then, try to edit all the "read" values in the "sh"
script by something for your OS (anything your want
that is a smarter GUI is perfect).

Have fun with my sources.
