A complete webhosting package that deliver a web GUI for administration.
Domain Technologie Control (DTC) is a set of PHP scripts that manage a MySQL
database that handles all the host information. It generates backup scripts,
statistic calculation scripts, and config files for bind, Apache, qmail, and
proftpd, using a single system UID/GID. With DTC, you can delegate the task
of creating subdomains, email, and FTP accounts to users for the domain
names they own.
