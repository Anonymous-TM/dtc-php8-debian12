dtc (0.25.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The chroot template is now built in /var/lib/dtc as default.
  * Now using a2enmod for enabling apache2 rewrite and ssl.
  * Long desc split in parts. (Closes: #403504).
  * Now using po-debconf internationalization (Closes: #402655).
  * The postinst doesn't modify other package config files anymore
    this is now done in a script to be launched manualy after the
    setup of the package (Closes: #402432).
  * Full review of the install procedure:
    - All forbidden (by debian policy) things are removed from the
      postinst.
    - The user has to cd into /usr/share/dtc/admin/install and run
      ./install in order to have the install script modify the
      configuration files of the daemons this package (dtc or it's
      brother dtc-postfix-courier) uses.
    - The postinst script saves the values answered in debconf in
      /root/.dtc_install as they are needed for the 2nd stage as
      well (like path for hosted files, domain name, mysql password
      and so on) as otherwise it would raise a "debconf is not a
      registry" error in Lintian.
    Side notes: This has been said to be the correct way (eg: debian
    policy compliant). If there is a smarter way, I'm open to any
    suggestions, but consider that it's not nice to ask twice the
    same thing to the user to the package, and that splitting the
    setup script in 2 parts (because touching other package config
    file) is not a very nice feature already. (Closes: #402834).

dtc (0.24.6-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload from the sponsor :)
  * Disabled maintainer scripts:
    - The maintainer scripts are currently way too intrusive.
      They need to be carefully rewritten. Until this is done, I disabled
      them
      (they are shipped in /usr/share/doc/{dtc,dtc-postfix}/ though).
    - disabled postinst check in rules.
