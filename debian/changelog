dtc (0.24.6-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload from the sponsor :)
  * Disabled maintainer scripts:
    - The maintainer scripts are currently way too intrusive.
      They need to be carefully rewritten. Until this is done, I disabled
      them
      (they are shipped in /usr/share/doc/{dtc,dtc-postfix}/ though).
    - disabled postinst check in rules.
