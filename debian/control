Description: Config files in /etc for both dtc and dtc-postfix-courier
 Domain Technologie Control (DTC) is a control panel for hosting.
 Using a web GUI for admin and accounting all hosting services, DTC
 can delegate the task of creating subdomains, email, and FTP accounts
 to users for the domain names they own. DTC manages a MySQL database
 containing all the hosting informations.
 .
 It has support for many programs (bind 8 and 9 and compatibles, MySQL,
 Apache 1.3, php4, qmail, postfix 2, amavis, clamav, spamassassin,
 courier 2, cyrus, dovecot, proftpd, webalizer, mod-log-sql, etc...)
 using config files and/or MySQL plugin (when service is non-critical).
 It can also generates backup scripts, calculation scripts, and config
 files. All this using a single system UID/GID.
 .
 It does as well monitoring of all trafic accounting per user and per
 service (and globaly using RRDTools).
 Since version 0.12, DTC is fully skinable and translated in several
 languages.

 .
 This specific package has dependencies to setup postfix, courier,
 phpmyadmin and other apps in once, so you don't have to setup all the
 dependencies by hand. The counter part is that you can't use this
 package when using Cyrus, Dovecot and others (for that, you need to
 use the package dtc which has a lot less dependencies).
